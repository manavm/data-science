```{r}
data = read.csv("datasets/OnlineNewsPopularity/OnlineNewsPopularity.csv", header = TRUE)
X <- read.csv(url("http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00332/OnlineNewsPopularity.zip"))
data %>% gather(day, count, weekday_is_monday:weekday_is_sunday) %>% head(15) -> data_days
data_days %>% select(-count) -> data
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
